    <p>KRS Hair & Wax Studio is family owned and operated, established in 2005 by partners in marriage and business, Christopher and Kimberly Wilder. New guests frequently ask what KRS means.  We are pleased to share that it stands for Kimberly, Rai and Symonne;  Christopher's wife and daughters, because his philosophy is that 'family makes the man.' </p>
    <p>KRS Hair & Wax Studio is an energetic and professional, full service salon, which specializes in hair care for all textures and ethnicities. We are known for our expertise in natural hair care, incredible hair extensions, precise cuts, creative color and luxurious lash extensions. Additionally, our Aesthetician is ranked by the WISN 12 A-List as one of the top two Waxers in the City of Milwaukee. With a focus on impeccable guest services and cultural diversity, we are Milwaukee's premier full service salon.</p>

    <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
    <p>Our Mission</p>
    <p>is to inspire, strengthen, uplift, warm and encourage people through beauty. We recognize that when people feel beautiful we are at our best. When we feel full and exuberant, we are able to share the best parts of ourselves with the world around us.</p>
    <p>Our Purpose</p>
    <p>Is to be a part of that sharing, to help others generate that initial feeling of goodness that propels them to enhance the world around them.</p>
    <p>Our Goal</p>
    <p>Within that purpose is to help our guests seek light within themselves so that they may project it upon their communities, that it may spread to the world at large; thereby attracting more physical, spiritual and financial positive energy. Upon projecting that light, our prayer is that each guest will allow it to return to themselves, receiving all of the gifts that the light brings.</p>
    <p>Our Mission</p>
    <p>is to spread light, one eyebrow, facial, haircut, and pedicure at a time. We hope that you will receive these gifts with the love in which they were sent!</p>
